# Platter: Custom Zoning Overhaul

Platter reworks zoning in Cities: Skylines 2 by adding "parcels" that contain zoning cells, providing a new way to grow buildings in your city.
It sits right between vanilla zoning and manual building plopping, giving you the control to create realistic neighborhoods, fill awkward gaps, and zone perfectly on curved roads without fighting the grid.

### Key Features
* **Manual Zoning:** Place "Parcels" exactly where you want them.
* **Vanilla Simulation:** Parcels use the game's native logic for zoning. Buildings spawn based on actual demand, land value, and desirability.
* **Precision Snapping:** Includes fully custom snapping options to align parcels and create perfect layouts.
* **Custom Setbacks:** Place zones back from the road to create front yards or widen roads later without demolition.
* **Curved Road Support:** Place zoning manually along curved roads.

### How to Use
1. Open the **Platter** tab from the zoning toolbar (or press `Ctrl+P`).
2. Select a parcel size and, optionally, your desired zone type.
3. Click to place the parcel manually — anywhere, at any angle.

### Alpha/Experimental Warning
**Platter is currently in ALPHA.**
This mod is experimental. While it is considered stable for testing, unexpected issues may occur.
* **Backup your save** before using this mod.
* Platter can be safely removed from a save by using the "Uninstall" button in the Mod Settings page.

### Support and Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, please head to the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/C2XQUYHwuV) for support.
* Please use **Skyve** to share your logs and playset. This is essential for troubleshooting. Sharing your save is also extremely helpful.
* Bug reports without logs are difficult to fix!

### Compatibility
* Fully compatible with major mods such as **Move It**, **Zone Reorganizer**, **Advanced Line Tool**, etc.

### Known Issues and FAQ
* **Grid Overrides:** The vanilla grid may sometimes override the Parcel grid. Investigation and fix is underway.
* **Snapping Quirks:** While custom snapping is included, snapping may sometimes act in unexpected ways depending on the angle. Improvements are planned.
