# Platter
Platter is a Cities: Skylines 2 mod that allows placing Parcels with vanilla zoning blocks. The goal is to create a tool that sits somewhere between vanilla and building plopping, giving players control over the zoning grid,
while still leveraging the vanilla zoning tools and building spawning/growth.
