	<ChangeLog>
		- **New: Parcels will now show missing road connection before placing them.**
		- **Fixed: parcels causing building parts and trees to disappear** The internal placeholder system has been fixed and improved.
		- **Fixed: Brush tool for trees / assets can delete parcels.** Placeholder system now correctly prevents this.
		- Added automatic migration system. Your save's parcel's will automatically be changed to their correct non-placeholder variant. This may not fix hidden props - you will need to force an update to the area by plopping something new, wiggling things with move it, or similar methods.
		- **Fixed: Several issues with the pre-zone dropdown**
		- Fixed: Dropdown not responsive with large tool panel.
		- Fixed: Missing blur.
		- Fixed: Sidebar also scrolls instead of overflowing the panel.
		- Fixed: Packs are not longer duplicated.
		- **Fixed: Mouse Wheel shortcuts accidentally cause keybind conflicts. **
		- Improvement: Changed language for overlay toggle for better clarity.
		- Improvement: Top left platter menu will accommodate longer sentences, such as in German.
		- Improvement: First image on tutorial is no longer squished.
		- Internal: Added ability for parcel to detect left, right, and backside connections, in preparation for future improvements.
