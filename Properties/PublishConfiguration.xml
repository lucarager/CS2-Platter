	<ChangeLog>
		A lot of polish and bug-fixing in this one, plus a whole new corner lot detection system!
		- *New road connection tracking system*
			- Parcels now track not just front, but side road connection (for corner lots)
			- Parcels will now show missing road connection icon before being plopped.
			- Fix: Parcels at 8.45m-8.41m from the road would sometimes indicate they are connected to the road when they shouldn't be.
		- *New parcel object visuals*:
			- Overhauled parcel overlay.
			- The parcel overlay now accurately matches the parcel's actual size. (Overlay was 0.5m larger)
			- Parcel overlay now shows whether a parcel is connected to a road on each side.
			- (internal) Fix incorrect node positions.
		- *Improved building verification tooltips*
			- Fixed: Building total was counting level 2+ and corner buildings. Now only counts level 1 buildings and tracks fronting/corner buildings separately.
			- Added new tooltip providing corner building information.
		- *Fix*: Fixed relocate button causing all buildings to become parcels when placed, and sometimes causing a crash.
		- Include latest translations.
		- Internal: Add changelog system.
