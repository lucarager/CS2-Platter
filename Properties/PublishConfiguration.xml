	<ChangeLog>
Numerous fixes and improvements, including:

- Reworked pre-zone panel:
	- Refactored: This should improve stability and fix various issues you may have encountered.
	- New: *Added support for Zone Reorganizer* and other mods that rearrange zones.
	- New: *Added a "Base Game" filter* that explicitly filters for zones that are NOT part of a pack.
	- Fixed: Tool panel would stick around after using Platter, then switching to other tools.
	- Fixed: Platter's filter was showing ALL packs, when not all packs related to zones. Now restricted to zone packs only.
- Improved performance:
	- Significantly improved the performance of parcel updates
	- Significantly improved the performance of the parcel overlay
- Tweaked Parcel overlay, further adjusted size and opacity of the new parcel overlay.
- Updated Translations.
- Further worked on internal changelog UI, unreleased.
